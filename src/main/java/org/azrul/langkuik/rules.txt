1) Only 1 id per entity
2) Relationship must be parameterized
3) Cannot handle inheritance of CustomType unless it is the same DAO (to be verified?)
4) Cannot display Collection field in a table (due to lazy loading)
5) Read-only field (can be due to rights) should be compulsory. Prefer using @WebField(... required=true) rather
   than @Basic(optional=false) since required will be managed
6) If nestedAllowed = true, the relationship need to be a) XToOne only b) Has to be Fetch.EAGER
7) Nested classes fields are limited to 10000, we cannot order by these fields.
8) Only 1 level of nested is allowed
9) Audit only for basic fields
